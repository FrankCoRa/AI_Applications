## Utilities
In my professional experience, this tool has significantly streamlined data extraction, saving countless hours by automating processes that would otherwise require manual copying. At work, we faced challenges with analyzing social media engagement to identify trends among users with similar expertise as our followers. Using this tool, we filtered and extracted insights from a group of +500 users, helping our marketing team refine their campaign strategies while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.

Although this tool doesn’t currently support platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn, it remains highly effective and user-friendly for data extraction on other websites. I encourage you to explore its potential as a valuable addition to your analytics toolkit.
